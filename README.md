Custom commands in Splunk allow you to create your own functionality in searches. See the references section for links to Splunk's documentation. Currently, the most popular was to write these commands is with Python but one can use a number of different laguages. This repo is an attempt to use Go to speed execution time and create a single executable file for inclusion.
